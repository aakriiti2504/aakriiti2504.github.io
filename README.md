# Belly Button Bio Diversity 

## Background: 

Rosa is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Rosa's role is to discover and document these bacterias. In particular, Rosa is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.
Her lab has partnered with "Improbable Beef", a food startup to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungii and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the ilusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. Rosa has a 
hypothesis that there is a microorganism found on the human body that can provide the next best taste. 

Here's what Rosa knows so far:

The human body is a source for thousands types of bacteria and different types of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a person's eyelashes for example. furthermore, 
between individuals, the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. Rosa hypothizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. To test her hypothesis, Rosa has sampled the navals of people across the
country  to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person's identity is annonymous and have been assigned an id number. Now Rosa wants to build a dashboard that both our research participants and fellow researchers can access. 
Those who participated in the study will be able to visit the website and select their id numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navals and gather other information. 





## Purpose : 

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate 
to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## What I am Creating : 
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

- Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
- Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
- Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard


## Tools Used :

- VS Code: We will use a text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.
- Web browser: We will use a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. We will use Chrome in our examples.
- Command-line interface: We will use the command-line interface to run a local server. If you're a Mac user, this means Terminal. If you're a Windows user, you'll be using Git Bash.
- GitHub: As we will deploy our final data visualization on GitHub Pages, we will need a GitHub account.
